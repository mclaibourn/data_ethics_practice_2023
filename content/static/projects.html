<h2>Project 1: Stepping Stones Report</h2>
<p>In the first half of the semester, while we’re learning more about R, reproducible data workflows, and ethical data practices, we’ll contribute to work for the City of Charlottesville to expand and enrich a community <a href="https://www.charlottesville.gov/1623/Stepping-Stones-Report">“Stepping Stones” report</a>, a collection of 39 metrics to gauge well-being in Charlottesville and Albemarle. Working in teams, we’ll divide up the metrics and build scripts to download updated measures, process them and combine them with the past data series, visualize and better contextualize changes over time. If we do our work well, it will make future iterations of this report easier to generate.</p>

<h3>Project Schedule</h3>
<p>In February, leaders in the City’s Department of Human Services will visit to give us some background and context for the Stepping Stones report.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Week 1 (due by class Jan 26): Individuals skim through the most recent <a href="https://www.charlottesville.gov/1623/Stepping-Stones-Report">Stepping Stones Report</a>. We’ll form into teams during class on Jan 26; each team is responsible for a collection of five measures, along with two or three that I will have acquired.</p></li>
<li><p>Week 2 (due by class Feb 2): Teams (a) start outlining purpose and policy contexts for two previously collected measures; (b) write an initial R script to download the first measure in their set and review city excel file for background and issues; and (c) begin work on request for measure not available online.</p></li>
<li><p>Week 3 (due by class Feb 9): Teams (a) continue outlining policy context, explanation of, and documentation for variable 1 along with previously collected measures; (b) update and complete code for acquiring and preparing the first measure in their set; and (c) write code that seeks to acquire the second measure in their set, reviewing city excel file for background and issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Week 4 (due by class Feb 16): Teams (a) continue outlining policy context, justification of, and documentation for variables 1 and 2 along previously collected measures; (b) update and complete code for acquiring and processing second measure in their set; (c) begin some initial visualizations of the measures that have been acquired; and (d) write code that seeks to acquire the third measure in their set, reviewing city excel file for background and issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Week 5 (due by class Feb 23): Teams (a) continue outlining policy context, purpose of, and documentation for variables 1, 2, and 3 along previously collected measures; (b) update and complete code for acquiring and processing third measure in their set; (c) create an initial R markdown file that weaves narration of metrics collected to date with visualization and documentation; and (d) write code that seeks to acquire the fourth measure in their set, reviewing city excel file for background and issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Week 6 (due by class Mar 2): Teams (a) finalize data acquisition and processing scripts for all four variables; (b) update and improve R markdown file to read in all metrics, visualize them, incorporate relevant policy context or changes, explain and document. Teams will briefly share/show the knitted markdown files in class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Once complete, we’ll add all files to Equity Center GitHub and the html report files to the class webpage.</strong></p>

<h2>Project 2: Multiple Equity Center Projects</h2>
<p>In the second half of the semester, we’ll divide up into new teams each working on a different project hosted by The Equity Center. These include projects centered on</p>
<ul>
<li>Court fees in eviction cases, based on Virginia Civil Court data</li>
<li>Police stops, based on the Virginia Community Policy Act data collection</li>
<li>Local rental markets, based on local tax assessment data</li>
<li>Humanizing the Orange Dot report, using using American Community Survey public-use microdata to build family profiles</li>
<li>Stepping Stones supplement, looking at racially disaggregated measures</li>
<li>And one more we’re still pinning down (if we need it)</li>
</ul>
<div id="project-schedule-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Project Schedule</h3>
<p>The timelines of these projects will vary more widely as the projects prgress, but a few key targets for all teams will include</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1 (due by midnight Mar 15): Individuals read through the brief project scoping documents (TBA) and, on a shared project sheet, identify their top choices for projects they’d like to work on. We’ll form into teams during class on Mar 16.</li>
<li>Week 2 (due by class Mar 23): Teams (a) generate an initial R script to download, read in, and explore primary data and (b) submit an initial list of at least three relevant citations to review – these might be research articles, think tank reports, book chapters, news articles, websites, or something else.</li>
<li>Week 3 (due by class Mar 30): Teams (a) revise the script to wrangle project data and continue data exploration and (b) submit brief reviews of previously suggested materials.</li>
<li>Week 4 (due by class Apr 6): Teams (a) generate initial R markdown file to share for peer feedback, including description of question, of available data, explorations of processed data, narrative and ideas drawn from initial literature review, and anything else that makes sense at this time. Teams will pair up in class to present to one another and provide thoughtful feedback.</li>
<li>Week 5 (due by class Apr 13): In addition to updates to data preparation scripts and analysis/presentation R markdown files, teams submit a new list of at least three additional relevant citations to review.</li>
<li>Week 6 (due by class Apr 20): In addition to updates to data preparation scripts and analysis/presentation R markdown files, teams submit brief reviews of newly suggested materials.</li>
<li>Week 7 (due by class Apr 27): In addition to updates to data preparation scripts and analysis/presentation R markdown files, teams use R markdown files to present (almost) final work to class.</li>
<li>Week 8 (due by May 4, in lieu of a final): Finalizing everything! R scripts to download, process and wrangle data and R markdown and knitted html files to analyze, visualize, and interpret data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Once complete, we’ll add all files to Equity Center GitHub and the html report files to the class webpage.</strong></p>
