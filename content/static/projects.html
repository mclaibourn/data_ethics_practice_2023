<h2>Project 1: Stepping Stones Report</h2>
<p>In the first half of the semester, while learning more about R, reproducible data workflows, and ethical data practices, we began contributing to work for the City of Charlottesville to expand and enrich a community <a href="https://www.charlottesville.gov/1623/Stepping-Stones-Report">“Stepping Stones” report</a>, a collection of 39 metrics to gauge well-being in Charlottesville and Albemarle. Working in teams, we divided up the metrics and built scripts to download updated measures and validate prior data, process and prepare the data, visualize the trends, and better contextualize changes over time. All our code and the resulting data are available on a <a href="https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/stepping-stones/">GitHub repository</a>; this will make future iterations of the report easier to generate and serves as a potential resource to expand to other localities.</p>
<p>Our work-to-date can be reviewed in the following team reports:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../projects/team1report.html">Team 1 report</a>: Math SOLs, High school degree attainment, School reports of physical violence, Students identified as economically disadvantaged, Children in foster care, Adults experiencing homelessness</li>
<li><a href="../projects/team2report.html">Team 2 report</a>: Students with limited English, Homeowner burden, School reports of alcohol and drug offenses, Child abuse and neglect assessments/investigations, Mothers with access to prenatal care, Reading SOLs</li>
<li><a href="../projects/team4report.html">Team 4 report</a>: On-time high school graduation rates, Children living with two parents, School suspensions, Children in need of supervision, Juvenile arrests for crimes against persons, Mothers with no or late access to prenatal care</li>
<li><a href="../projects/team5report.html">Team 5 report</a>: Children living below poverty, Per capita income, Youth labor force participation and unemployment, Kindergartners identified for reading intervention, School division average daily attendance, Births to mothers with less than a 12th grade education, Sexually transmitted infections in youth (awaiting data transfer)</li>
<li><a href="../projects/team6report.html">Team 6 report</a>: Divorce rate, Voter registration, Births to mothers with less than a 12th grade education, Rental burden, School reports of weapons possession, Juvenile delinquency judgments, Arrests for underage alcohol offenses</li>
</ul>
<p>The Equity Center at UVA will be continuing this work to compile the updated metrics into a single report in collaboration with the City’s Department of Human Services.</p>

<h2>Project 2: Multiple Equity Center Projects</h2>
<p>In the second half of the semester, we’ll divide up into new teams each working on a different project hosted by The Equity Center, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Court fees in eviction cases, based on Virginia Civil Court data</li>
<li>Police stops, based on the Virginia Community Policy Act data collection</li>
<li>Local rental markets, based on local tax assessment data</li>
<li>Humanizing the Orange Dot report, using using American Community Survey public-use microdata to build family profiles</li>
<li>Stepping Stones supplement, looking at racially disaggregated data</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Schedule</h3>
<p>The timelines of these projects will vary more widely as the projects progress, but a few key targets for all teams will include</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1 (due by class Mar 16): Individuals read through the brief project scoping documents and think about what project they’d like to work on. We’ll form into teams during class.</li>
<li>Week 2 (due by class Mar 23): Teams (a) generate an initial R script to download, read in, and explore primary data and (b) submit an initial list of at least three relevant citations to review – these might be research articles, think tank reports, book chapters, news articles, websites, or something else.</li>
<li>Week 3 (due by class Mar 30): Teams (a) revise the script to wrangle project data and continue data exploration and (b) submit brief reviews of previously suggested materials.</li>
<li>Week 4 (due by class Apr 6): Teams (a) generate initial R markdown file to share for peer feedback, including description of question, of available data, explorations of processed data, narrative and ideas drawn from initial literature review, and anything else that makes sense at this time. Teams will pair up in class to present to one another and provide thoughtful feedback.</li>
<li>Week 5 (due by class Apr 13): In addition to updates to data preparation scripts and analysis/presentation R markdown files, teams submit a new list of at least three additional relevant citations to review.</li>
<li>Week 6 (due by class Apr 20): In addition to updates to data preparation scripts and analysis/presentation R markdown files, teams submit brief reviews of newly suggested materials.</li>
<li>Week 7 (due by class Apr 27): In addition to updates to data preparation scripts and analysis/presentation R markdown files, teams use R markdown files to present (almost) final work to class.</li>
<li>Week 8 (due by May 4, in lieu of a final): Finalizing everything! R scripts to download, process and wrangle data and R markdown and knitted html files to analyze, visualize, and interpret data.</li>
<li>Post Project (duy by May 4): Individuals submit a <a href="../contribution/">contribution memo</a> to me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Once complete, we’ll add all files to Equity Center GitHub and the html report files to the class webpage.</strong></p>
