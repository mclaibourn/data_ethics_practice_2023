We'll add resources here as they become relevant or we find them. Feel free to send along things you've found useful!

## Getting Started with R

* [Instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages](../install/).
* [Posit (formerly RStudio) Cloud Guide](https://posit.cloud/plans/free), run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser, a great way to start if you're struggling with installation (you can get 25 free hours of use a month, but it's not really designed to handle large datasets).
* [Posit (formerly RStudio) Primers](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers),
* [The Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html), suggestions for good coding practices
* [Stata to R::Cheat Sheet](https://mentalbreaks.rbind.io/posts/stata-to-r/)
* [LearnR4Free](https://www.learnr4free.com/)
